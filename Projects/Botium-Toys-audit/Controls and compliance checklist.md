**Recommendations:**

After review and creating a checklist of all the vulnerabilites and the area that can be improved within the organisation (Botium Toys) here are few important point that need to be patch with to most priority for moving forward safely and securely:

* Expanding in the online arena requires safety and confidentiality of the data of the users that they are giving, the SPIIs like the credit card details safety is the point of biggest concern. All the Botium employees have access to the data stored internally which means the credit card data and its owners as well. Employees are the biggest threat to any company or organisation so imply:  
1. Least Privilege  
2. Encryption  
3. Separation of duties

               
             This will provide a safe environment for storing SPIIs/PIIs

* Existing Password policies are weak and need to be improved. 

* Establishing a Centralized Password Managment System like Multifactor Authentication will improve the security posture of the company.

* The legacy systems maintence should be done on a regular basis to ensure they cannot be exploited easily.
